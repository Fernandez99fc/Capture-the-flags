Begin with a port scan using nmap:
![Screenshot (161)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff43ee1e-b6a1-4eb7-9cfe-2a2ad6d1fdda)

- -sS - Half open scan

- -sV - detect service version

- --min-rate= minimum rate at which packet is sent

- -p- -  Scan all 65535 ports

  We have 6 ports open:
  ssh(22), http(8080), http(80), smb(139 & 445), ajp13(8009)

  We begin by visit the http services running on port 80, then on port 8080 to see what has been hosted.

  Visiting port 80, "ip address:80" we see this message:
  ![Screenshot (162)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cefeaf7e-ffb3-4267-a77f-9204fd6cd90c)

After viewing the page source, we found nothing useful.

Visiting port 8080 with "ip address:8080". We can see it's hosting an apache server and we can se the version apache tomcat/ 9.0.7:

Using gobuster to scan for hidden files and directories, a directory named /development was found, containing two files dev.txt and j.txt.

By reading both files, we have a hint that smb and apache has been configured, and a warning telling the user that the password hashes stored in /etc/shadow were easily cracked and should be changed. Good!

Using gobuster on port 8080

Nothing much to be done there.

Since we realized that the system runs a smb server, we can target that.

Firstly, we can use a tool called enum4linux to gather information about the smb server:

- a - For all information

We can also see that it has two shares hosted, which is the <b> Anonymous & IPC$</b>.

Anoymous is a disk share and we would like to take a look at that. 

A common misconfiguration in access a share is enabling anonymous access. So we can try to access the share without entering a password.

We can use "smbclient" to access and list shares.

<b> smbclient -L //ip address/share -U anonymous -p 445</b>

- - L - To list shares

- //ip address/share
  
- - U - specify username
  
-  - p - specify port number
